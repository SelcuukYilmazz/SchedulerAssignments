# SchedulerAssignments
This project calculates two types of scheduling.

#### 1 - Dynamic Programming
You can see dynamic programming output as "solution_dynamic.json"
#### 2 - Greedy Programming
You can see dynamic programming output as "solution_dynamic.json"

in dynamic programming program tries to schedule as possible as job. But in greedy Program just tries to do all jobs in given time.

# How to Use:
Program takes inputs as argument and it must be json file. Then prints output as json file

# Inputs:
#### Name: This input gives jobs description
#### Start: This input gives starting time of job
#### Duration: This input gives duration of job
#### Importance: This input changes importance of job
#### Maellard: This input changes importance of job. If this input True then job 1000 times more important than its importance level.
